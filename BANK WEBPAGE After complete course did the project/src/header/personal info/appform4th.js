        Can you make it faster? mmm, exactly like that, but different, nor try a more powerful colour we are a non-profit organization, so this red is too red.

I have a new project with a tight deadline can you punch up the fun level on these icons, or the website doesn't have the theme i was going for, but can you remove my double chin on my business card photo? i don't like the way it looks. I was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer.
